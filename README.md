# Not-Your-Enemy

**Not Your Enemy** (NYE) Outreach Application has gone by many names. It's current name is just our best effort to engage people on the street.  Change it, use it as you wish!  The application itself is a framework for outreach.  If you're like me - a bit of a nerd - you might be an extrovert, but that doesn't mean you always organize your thoughts well sharing the Gospel.  If that's you, than this app is an excellent scaffolding for Gospel Outreach.  The conversation flow of the application is as follows:

- NYE begans with an ice-breaker question.  
- We then look problems with the participants worldview.  At no point during this apologetic should a participant pushed toward an opinion.  The material is self-explanatory and exists to amplify cultural doubt. *(Can be skipped)*
- The next portion questions the problems with the world as outlined by whichever religion was selected.  *(Can be skipped)*
- The final section is a presentation of the individuals culpability before God and the solution in Christ or another religions attempted solution.

If you want to use this tool to help you stay on track during outreach, feel it would promote engagement or want to use it to create an outreach framework for your culture or region then feel free to use it!

## Release

A build of the application is available - [Not Your Enemy 1.25 - APK](./RELEASE/not-your-enemy.apk)

- You will need to enable the installation of *unknown sources* on your Android device.
- This release can run on some very old hardware (don't have a list, but try this on your old device, you might be suprised)

## Customization

Much of the structure of Outreach Conversation can not be changed without manually editing the application code.  Apologetic discussions and personal culpability can be changed somewhat by editing their JSON files in the assets folder. JSON *yes* and *no* values represent which slide to proceed to next (the absense of both values indicates and endpoint of a conversation section)

Wording of all slides and all of the ice breaker questions can be edited in the projects default [strings.xml](/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file.

## API (Optional)

NYE has a server-side *PHP* based API in the [API](./API) folder of this repo.  This is a simple email routing script (which uses *php-mailer*).  It uses your email provider to forward POST requests to a selected email.  In this manner you can forward basic outreach metrics (interviewee's belief and culpability statement) to your email.

To configure this service, you will need to place the PHP script on your webserver.  The configuration details in the [config.php](./API/config.php) file of the API will need to be filled out with your email service providers details. In the Android project the [strings_config.xml](/app/src/main/res/values/strings_config.xml) file will need to be altered to point to the folder location of your API script.  Once *api_enabled* is set to true in *strings_config.xml* future APK builds will have the Send/Save feature enabled. If this feature is not enabled, the Send/Save buttons in the app will be marked *unavailable*
