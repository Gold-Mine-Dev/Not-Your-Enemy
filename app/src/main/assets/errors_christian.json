  "law":"<b>Every individual will be judged*.  Each breach of law is punishable*</b>. Every law given of God represents Him*.  When someone rejects God's law they are not only creating grevious offense, they are despising God's nature.  Violations of the law are rejections of God and will be severely punished. (<b>'the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil'</b>*)  [<em>Heb 9:27, Rom 6:23, John 1:1, John 3:19</em>]",
  "punishment":"<b>Violating even one law brings the sentence of death*</b>.  This physical death provisions eternal torment for violations of the law.  Therefore <b>the physical body is destroyed while the soul is sent by a just God to hell</b>.  Hell is described as a fiery burning lake*, eternal punishment* and full of crying and agony*. [<em>Romans 6:23, Rev. 21:8, Matt 25:46, Matt 13:50</em>]",
  "hope":"<b>The punishment of death we deserve was paid by one who is innocent</b> (<em>i.e. does not have to pay the penalty themselves</em>). God Himself came to earth, and lived a perfect moral life.  <b>He commands we must turn from evil and turn to Him</b>. God was killed by evil man.  God - in the person of Jesus - could not remain dead and rose three days after His murder.  Jesus, having received the punishment for all sinful men can justify (<em>make men right with God - the law giver</em>) men who trust and obey Him (<em>Philippians 3:9</em>). <b>Christ's death on behalf of man's guilt and resurrection was the only remedy for breaching God's law and any man facing the punishment of hell</b>."
